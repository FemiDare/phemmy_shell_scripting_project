I created a new directory named "shell-scripting" to hold my scripts and changed directory into the created folder

I created a script file named "user-input.sh" and using the vi command proceeded to edit the created script file

I copied and pasted the given script which when ran prompts the user to input their name and then "echos" prints a greeting addressed to the inputed name as it reads said name from the input.

I had to change the permissions of the file making it an executable file and then ran the script

I created a script file named "navigating-linux-filesystem.sh" and using the vi command I editted the contents of the file by pasting the provided script

I added some lines at the beginning of the file so the when running the script there is an initial command to display the current contents of the directory 

I also editted the name of the directory and files to be created when the script is ran

I changed the permissions on the file making it an executable file and then ran the script

I created a new file named "backup.sh" and editting via vi command, editted the contents of the file by pasting the provided script in it

I then made the file an executable file using the chmod command. Then proceeded to run the script file.

The script was having issues in running and efforts were made to try rectifying and adjusting the script so as to get it to work properly.
