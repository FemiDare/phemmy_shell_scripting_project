I created a new directory named "shell-scripting" to hold my scripts and changed directory into the created folder

I created a script file named "user-input.sh" and using the vi command proceeded to edit the created script file

I copied and pasted the given script which when ran prompts the user to input their name and then "echos" prints a greeting addressed to the inputed name as it reads said name from the input.

I had to change the permissions of the file making it an executable file and then ran the script

I created a script file named "navigating-linux-filesystem.sh" and using the vi command I editted the contents of the file by pasting the provided script

I added some lines at the beginning of the file so the when running the script there is an initial command to display the current contents of the directory 

I also editted the name of the directory and files to be created when the script is ran

I changed the permissions on the file making it an executable file and then ran the script
